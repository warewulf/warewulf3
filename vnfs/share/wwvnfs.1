.SH NAME
wwvnfs \- create Warewulf Virtual Network File System
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B wwvnfs
.RI [options]\ name
.SH DESCRIPTION
When wwvnfs is run for the first time on a VNFS, it will attempt to create a
configuration file in the default warewulf config dir (\fI/etc/warewulf/vnfs/\fR) or in
the users \fI~/.warewulf/vnfs\fR directory. Once the configuration file has been written
and updated, you can simply run '\fIwwvnfs [vnfs_name]\fR' to rebuild the image. You can
temporarily override any of these options via command line arguments.
