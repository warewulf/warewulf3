Warewulf distributes some third-party software as a convenience to our
users.  While Warewulf itself is licensed under a DOE license (a
derivative of the BSD license), the third-party software may have different
licensing terms, including the GNU General Public License (GPL).

As it is not a derivative work of these other products, the Warewulf code
is not subject to the terms of these other licenses.  However, since the
distribution contains all these separately-licensed works, each license
must be respected and followed when redistributing Warewulf packages.

The Warewulf developers on behalf of Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory
have contacted the upstream maintainers of these projects and notified them
of our intentions.
