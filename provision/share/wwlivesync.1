.SH NAME
wwlivesync \- Synchronize nodes.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B wwlivesync
.RI [options]\ nodes
.SH DESCRIPTION
The live sync command will spawn rsync commands to update the running node
operating system (VNFS) live. This command should only be used for minor VNFS
updates, as large updates including library load could potentially break binary
compatibility.
.PP
.\" TeX users may be more comfortable with the \fB<whatever>\fP and
.\" \fI<whatever>\fP escape sequences to invode bold face and italics,
.\" respectively.
.SH OPTIONS
.B wwlivesync
options:
.PP
.B \-l, \-\-lookup      
.RS 4
Identify nodes by specified property (default: "name").
.RE
.PP
.B \-f, \-\-files       
.RS 4
Pass a list of files to sync instead of the entire VNFS.
.RE
.PP
.B \-\-show        
.RS 4
Just print what it would do instead of actually do it.
.RE
.PP
.B \-\-logdir      
.RS 4
Directory of per-node logs (/var/log/wwlivesync).
.RE
.PP
.B \-\-verbose     
.RS 4
Increase verbosity level.
.RE
.PP
.B \-\-quiet       
.RS 4
Decrease verbosity level.
.RE
.PP
.B \-\-debug       
.RS 4
Print debugging messages.
.RE
.PP
.B \-h, \-\-help        
.RS 4
Display usage summary.
.RE
.SH TARGETS
The target(s) specify which node(s) will be affected by the chosen
action(s).  By default, node(s) will be identified by their name(s).
Use the \fI\-\-lookup\fR option to specify another property (e.g., "hwaddr"
or "groups").
.PP
All targets can be bracket expanded as follows:
.RS 4
n00[0-99]       All nodes from n0000 through n0099 (inclusive)
n00[00,10-99]   n0000 and all nodes from n0010 through n0099
.RE
.SH EXAMPLES
.nf
# wwlivesync n00[00-19]

# wwlivesync --ipaddr 10.0.1.10 --netmask 255.255.0.0 --vnfs=sl6.vnfs 
    --bootstrap=`uname -r` n0000 n0001

# wwsh node new DEFAULT --groups=grp1,test
# wwsh provision node DEFAULT --vnfs=sl6.vnfs --bootstrap=`uname -r`
